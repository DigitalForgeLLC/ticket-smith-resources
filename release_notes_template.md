## Usage Instructions for Claude

When creating release notes using this template:

### DeskPro Compatibility:
- **Optimized formatting** for clean pasting into DeskPro support system
- **Date as paragraph text** - no heading formatting on the date line
- **Heading 3 format** for all section titles (###)
- **Standard markdown** for bullets, links, and text formatting

### Content Guidelines:
1. **Start with the date and standard opening line** ("The latest version of Profit Max is pending release.")
2. **Prioritize user-facing changes** over technical implementation details
3. **Focus on business value** - how changes help with profitability analysis
4. **Use Profit Max terminology** consistently (modules: Sales, Margin, Customers, Items, MVA)
5. **Reference specific screens/widgets** where changes occur
6. **Explain the "why"** behind changes when relevant
7. **CRITICAL: Every bullet point must begin with Updated, Added, or Fixed (bolded)**
8. **Organize bullets logically**: Added first, then Updated, then Fixed
9. **Group related items**: Within each section, group bullets that relate to the same feature/screen
10. **Use blank lines** to visually separate different logical groups of changes

### Writing Style:
- **Clear, direct language** - avoid overly technical jargon
- **Business-focused** - emphasize impact on profit optimization and decision-making
- **Specific examples** when helpful for understanding
- **Consistent formatting** with existing release notes
- **Professional but accessible tone**

### Structure Priorities:
1. **Major Features** (new modules, significant capabilities)
2. **Feature Enhancements** (improvements to existing functionality)
3. **Additional Changes** organized in logical order:
   - **Added** items first (new features, columns, capabilities)
   - **Updated** items second (improvements, enhancements, changes)
   - **Fixed** items third (bug fixes, issue resolutions)
4. **Group related items** within each category by feature/screen/module
5. **UI/UX Updates** (better user experience, new visualizations)
6. **Technical Updates** (backend improvements, data accuracy)

### Key Phrases to Use:
- "The latest version of Profit Max is pending release." (standard opening line)
- "New Major Feature: [Name]"
- "Additional Changes In This Release"
- **Required bullet starters (always bolded):**
  - "**Updated** [component] to..."
  - "**Added** [functionality] to [module]..."
  - "**Fixed** an issue where..."

### References to Include:

  - **Fixed** - for bug fixes, issue resolutions, or error corrections
- **Markdown links** for documentation: [text](url)
- **Indented sub-bullets** for related items under main features

### Technical Considerations:
- **Mention rollout timing** if features are being gradually released
- **Include prerequisites** (e.g., Exporter updates, browser requirements)

- **Reference integration impacts** (SalesPad, Business Central, etc.)

### Call-to-Action Elements:
