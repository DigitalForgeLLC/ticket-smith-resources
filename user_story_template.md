1. **Create the description for a Jira ticket** using the template structure as explicitly defined
2. **Follow the template's sections and formatting** exactly

4. **Ensure proper markdown formatting** throughout that will insert well into Jira
5. **Maintain professional tone** while preserving the user's intent

- Use bullet points for clarity and scannability
- Bold group headings within Acceptance Criteria when needed
- Use assertive language ("will" instead of "should") for criteria
- Keep font size consistent throughout

### Language Guidelines:
- Start Story section with standard user story format
- Keep Context section concise and business-focused
- Make Acceptance Criteria actionable and testable
- Focus Testing section on user perspective, not technical implementation
- Use clear, direct language that minimizes ambiguity

**The goal is to transform brief feature requests into comprehensive, user-centered stories that provide clear direction for development teams and ensure features deliver real value to users.**
