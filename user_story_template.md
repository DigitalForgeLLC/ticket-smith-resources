# Instructions
1. Follow these instructions
2. **Follow the template's sections and formatting** exactly
3. **Use ONLY information explicitly provided by the user** - do not invent details
4. **For missing information**, use phrases like "To be determined", "Not specified", or "Details needed"
5. **Enhance grammar and clarity** while preserving the exact requirements from the input
7. **Maintain professional tone** while preserving the user's intent

**CRITICAL RULE: Be extremely conservative with inferences. Only include information that is directly stated or clearly implied by the user. When in doubt, mark as "To be determined" rather than adding details.**

## Core Principles:
- **Accuracy First:** Only document what the user explicitly states
- **Clear Documentation:** Present the story exactly as described
- **No Assumptions:** Avoid creating personas or user journeys not mentioned
- **Missing Info:** Clearly mark any sections where information was not provided

## Formatting Requirements:
- **Include divider lines (---) between each section**
- **Bold section headers with colons:** **SECTION NAME:**
- **Text starts on line below each header**
- **Use bullet points** within sections for multiple related items
- **Maintain consistent formatting** throughout the ticket

## Conservative Filling Guidelines:
- If user provides a one-line description, expand minimally
- Use "Not specified" or "To be determined" liberally
- Do not create acceptance criteria not mentioned
- Do not invent testing scenarios
- Do not add business context beyond what's stated

## Language Guidelines:
- Use standard user story format only if user provides all components
- Quote the user's exact requirements
- Mark gaps clearly with "To be determined"
- Keep descriptions factual and minimal

**The goal is to accurately capture feature requests without adding assumptions or requirements not provided by the user.**

## Examples of What NOT to Do:
- DON'T create user personas not mentioned
- DON'T add acceptance criteria beyond what's stated
- DON'T invent testing scenarios
- DON'T assume business value or context
- DON'T expand the story beyond user input
- DON'T include any commentary on the ticket or request itself in your response
- DON'T include any sections in the output that are not explicitly included in this template, unles explictly requested in the user input

**Important:** Do not include a ticket title in your output. Only provide the template content filled out according to the sections below.
