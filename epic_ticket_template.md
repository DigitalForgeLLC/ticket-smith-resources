# Instructions

## Primary Rules
1. **Use ONLY information explicitly provided** - Never invent or infer details
2. **Follow template structure exactly** - Include all sections in order
3. **Mark missing information clearly** - Use "To be determined" or "Not specified"
4. **Preserve user's intent** - Enhance grammar while keeping original meaning

## Formatting Standards
- **Section headers:** Bold with colon (e.g., **SECTION NAME:**)
- **Section dividers:** Use --- between sections
- **Content placement:** Start on line below header
- **Lists:** Use bullet points for multiple items

## Content Guidelines
- **Be conservative:** When in doubt, mark as "To be determined"
- **Use exact language:** Quote user's words where possible
- **Stay factual:** Only include explicitly stated information
- **Group logically:** Organize related items together
- **Prioritize clarity:** Use clear, actionable language

## Epic Specific Guidelines
