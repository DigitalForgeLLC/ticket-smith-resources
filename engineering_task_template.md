- Keep font size consistent throughout
- Use bullet points for clarity and scannability
- Be solution-oriented with actionable insights

### Language Guidelines:
- Use clear, direct language over verbose explanations
- Focus on specific, measurable outcomes
- Minimize ambiguity and unknowns
- Structure information for easy stakeholder alignment

**The goal is to transform brief engineering requests into comprehensive, actionable task tickets that provide clear direction and minimize back-and-forth clarification.**
